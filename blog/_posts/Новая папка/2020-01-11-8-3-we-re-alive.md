Hey ho,

even though we don't post blog posts too often, the SE&L team is alive and kickin'. Of course this is an open source project, so if you see an error, you could essentially fix it yourself and provide your fix via [github](https://github.com/stormearthandlava/stormearthandlava.github.io). A real blogpost with actual content to welcome you into 8.3 will come soon.

Stay healthy!

Yours sincerely,<br/>
